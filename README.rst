Security Estimates for Lattice Problems
=======================================

This `Sage <http://sagemath.org>`__ module provides functions for estimating the concrete security
of `Learning with Errors <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Learning_with_errors>`__ instances.

The main intend of this estimator is to give designers an easy way to choose parameters resisting
known attacks and to enable cryptanalysts to compare their results and ideas with other techniques
known in the literature.

Usage Examples
--------------

::

    sage: from estimator import *
    sage: Kyber512
    LWEParameters(n=512, q=3329, Xs=D(σ=1.22, μ=0.00), Xe=D(σ=1.00, μ=0.00), m=1024, tag='Kyber 512')

    sage: primal_usvp(Kyber512)
         rop: ≈2^140.9
         red: ≈2^140.9
           δ: 1.004111
           β:      382
           d:      973
         tag:     usvp
         
    sage: primal_bdd(Kyber512)
         rop: ≈2^135.9
         pre: ≈2^134.8
         svp: ≈2^135.0
           β:      361
           η:      406
           d:     1025           
         tag:      bdd

    sage: params = LWEParameters(n=512, q=3329, Xs=ND.UniformMod(3), Xe=ND.CentredBinomial(eta=8), m=1024)
    sage: primal_usvp(params)
         rop: ≈2^149.0
         red: ≈2^149.0
           δ: 1.003914
           β:      410
           d:      944
         tag:     usvp
         
Status
------

We do not have feature parity with the old estimator yet:

- [X] primal attack on LWE via uSVP using BKZ simulators or assuming the GSA
- [X] primal attack on LWE (effectively) via BDD using BKZ simulators or assuming the GSA
- [ ] hybrid primal attack on LWE
- [ ] dual attack on LWE
- [ ] Aroroa-GB attack on LWE
- [ ] Coded-BKW attack on LWE

We also plan:

- [ ] attack on NTRU pulic keys (using overstretched parameters)
- [ ] SIS attack  
         
Evolution
---------

This code is evolving, new results are added and bugs are fixed. Hence, estimations from earlier
versions might not match current estimations. This is annoying but unavoidable at present. We
recommend to also state the commit that was used when referencing this project.

Contributions
-------------

Our intent is for this estimator to be maintained by the research community. For example, we
encourage algorithm designers to add their own algorithms to this estimator and we are happy to help
with that process.
