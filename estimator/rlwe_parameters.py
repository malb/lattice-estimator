        """Reduce this instance of RLWE to LWE.

        This operates under the assumption that no current known attacks
        exploit the ring structure of RLWE beyond its LWE structure.

        The reduction starts with an RLWE instance with sample

            a(x) = a_0 + a_1 x + ... + a_{N-1}x^{N-1}

        and secret key

            s(x) = s_0 + s_1 x + ... + s_{N-1}x^{N-1},

        where b(x) = a(x)s(x) + m(x) + e(x) mod (x^N + 1).

        Noting that b_i x^i = sum_{j+k=i mod N} a_j s_k x^{j+k}, (i.e., values
        have their sign inverted if j+k > N), the reduction converts the
        instance to the following set of LWE samples:

            (a_0,     -a_{N-1}, -a_{N-2}, ..., -a_1),
            (a_1,      a_0,     -a_{N-1}, ..., -a_2),
            (a_2,      a_1,      a_0,     ..., -a_3),
             ...                          ...
            (a_{N-1},  a_{N-2},  a_{N-3}, ...,  a_0),

        With secret s = (s_0, s_1, ..., s_{N-1}),
        and b = (b_0, b_1, ..., b_{N-1}).

        As such, an attack against LWE with dimension N is also an attack
        against RLWE for polynomials of degree N.
